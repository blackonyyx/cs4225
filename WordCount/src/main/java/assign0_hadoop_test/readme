############### Assignment 0: Hadoop Test #####################

Use scripts to compile your codes
$ ./compile_run		# compile and run your code on sample dataset, check the result
These scripts will also be used on marking. So ensure your output format is the same as 'answer.txt'

In this assignment, you should ONLY modify:
-- assign0_hadoop_test.WordCount.java

Do NOT add new files.
